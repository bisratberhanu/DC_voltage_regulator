# DC Voltage Regulator

This project aims to design a DC voltage regulator that takes an input of 220V AC and converts it to a stable 20V DC output with a constant current. The project includes comprehensive documentation, LTSpice simulation, and images of the signal at each stage of the conversion process.

## Prerequisites

Before running the LTSpice simulation, make sure you have LTSpice installed on your system. You can download it from the official website: [LTSpice Download](https://www.analog.com/en/design-center/design-tools-and-calculators/ltspice-simulator.html)

## Simulation

To run the LTSpice simulation, follow these steps:

1. Open LTSpice on your system.
2. Navigate to the project folder and locate the simulation file.
3. Open the simulation file in LTSpice.
4. Run the simulation and observe the output waveform.

## Documentation

The project includes comprehensive documentation that provides detailed information about the design, components used, and the conversion process. It also includes images of the signal at each stage of the conversion, allowing for better understanding and analysis.

## Usage

To use the DC voltage regulator, follow these steps:

1. Connect the 220V AC input to the designated input terminal.
2. Connect the load to the output terminal.
3. Power on the circuit and observe the output voltage and current.
